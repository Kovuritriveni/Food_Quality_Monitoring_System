# 🥗 Automated Food Quality Monitoring System Using Deep Learning and Image Processing

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to **automate the process of monitoring food quality** in bulk storage using **deep learning and image processing techniques**. Traditional manual inspections are labor-intensive and inconsistent. By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **real-time image capture**, this system can detect signs of spoilage such as mold, color change, and texture variations with high accuracy.

The prototype is built using an **Arduino Uno**, a **webcam**, and an **LCD display**. The CNN model processes the food images and categorizes them as **"fresh"** or **"spoiled"**, allowing timely alerts and reducing food waste.

## 🖼️ Working Principle

1. A **webcam** captures images of stored food items.
2. Images are analyzed by a trained **CNN model** to detect spoilage.
3. The **Arduino Uno** controls the workflow and displays results on an **LCD**.
4. If food is detected as spoiled, the system provides a real-time alert.
5. Additional components like **DC motors**, **relays**, and **servo motors** can automate responses like tray movement or cooling control.
